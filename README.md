Week 4 - Sudoku Solver
-----------------------
This week's challenge was to create an engine that solves even the hardest Sudoku puzzle.

####To use:
1. Create a new grid with the 81 numbers as an argument with blank cells as 0. 

For example:
```ruby
grid = Grid.new(015003002000100906270068430490002017501040380003905000900081040860070025037204600)
```

2. Use .solve to solve the puzzle
For example:
```ruby
grid.solve
```
